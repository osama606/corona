      "answer":
          "Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that can cause diseases such as the common cold, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). A new type of corona virus was discovered after it was identified as a cause of the spread of a disease that began in China in 2019.",

    {
      "question": "How long does the new Corona virus stay on a dry surface?",
      "answer":
          "There is currently no data available on the degree of persistence of the emerging corona virus on surfaces. The data obtained from laboratory studies conducted on the Corona virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome and the Corona virus that causes respiratory syndrome in the Middle East have shown that the degree of persistence of the virus in the environment depends on several factors, including the relative temperature, humidity and the type of surface. WHO continues to monitor existing evidence about the emerging coronavirus and will provide the most recent information as soon as this evidence becomes available.",

          "How can the sheets, towels and soiled clothes be washed for patients with Covid-19 infection?",
      "answer": "All individuals who handle bedding, towels and clothing for patients with Covid-19 infection should do the following:"
          " A) Wear appropriate personal protective equipment, including: durable gloves, a muzzle, eye protection (face shield / goggles), a medical gown with long sleeves and a bib (if the garment is not waterproof), and tall or closed shoes, before touching any dirty blankets and clothes."

          "What personal protective equipment (PPE) should health-care workers who administer the nasopharyngeal mucous or nasopharyngeal swabs be used for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection?",
      "answer":
          "Health-care workers who take nasal or pharyngeal swab samples from patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection should receive good training in this medical procedure and wear a clean, long-sleeved, non-sterile gown, medical mask, and eye protection (face shield or goggles) And gloves. This medical procedure should be carried out in a separate / isolated room, and health care workers should ask patients to cover their mouths with a medical mask or tissue.",

          "Is there a model for equipping patient isolation wards with associated types, products and health requirements?",
      "answer":
          "Work is underway to develop a model to equip the isolation ward. The characteristics of personal protective equipment for health workers caring for patients with novel coronavirus infection can be found in the disease toolkit.",

      "question":
          "What are the recommendations for using chlorine to clean and sterilize hands in the context of the emerging corona virus?",
      "answer":
          "A dilute chlorine solution (0.05 percent) can be used to sterilize hands when an alcohol-based hand sanitizer or soap is not available. However, it is not recommended to use a dilute chlorine solution when alcohol-based hand sanitizer or soap and water are available because it has a higher risk of causing irritation to the hands and other health damage from preparing and diluting the chlorine solutions.",
    },
    {
      "question":
      "Can the virus develop?",
      "answer":
      "We're still in the very early stages of understanding this disease, and there's still a lot we don't know. Current information indicates that the virus may cause mild flu-like symptoms and severe illness. While it may present as a mild disease at first, it may progress to a more severe disease, and people with existing chronic conditions appear to be more likely to develop a more severe disease. The elderly also appear to be more susceptible to severe disease",
    },
    {
      "question":
      "Is there a justification for panic among people?",
      "answer":
      "No, not necessarily. Reports indicate that infection with the emerging coronavirus-2019 may cause mild to severe disease, and in some cases it may become fatal. According to the current data, most of the new cases appear to have a milder disease, and it is still among the types of symptoms that are milder caused by respiratory diseases..",

    {
      "question":
      "Are unhealthy habits such as smoking hookah and poor infrastructure in some countries can have a significant impact on the spread of disease? ",
      "answer":
      "Shisha smoking is certainly harmful to health, but WHO guidelines for countries and individuals stipulate the possibility of disease spread due to contact with animals, contact with contaminated food, or transmission from person to person.",
